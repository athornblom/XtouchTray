As the case and the latches do not bear any load, you can use a low infill. 25% is more than enough. Use 2-3 perimeter walls The case is designed to be printed with the face on the print bed, that should get you a nice surface to look at.
Print the latches as they are designed and use supports under the overhang. Use at least 3 perimeter walls, again infill doesnÂ´t matter that much.
